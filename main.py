#  RECOMMENDATIONS 

#create variables with letters and numbers

#the name of the variables must be without numbers // , 
# //just in case you've to used numbers, you can add the number with a "_" before the number.
# //example : name_1

#If the variable's name is a phrase or many words must be the first word in lowercase, 
# //and the other ones start in uppercase, example : firstNameUser

#double quotes are for simplify if i need to organize more my code, Line 14-19

# Alt + arrowpointers (up, down) are to move the codelines to other place

# Alt + click to select many diferent lines for write and same time
